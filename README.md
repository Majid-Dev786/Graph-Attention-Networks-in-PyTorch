# Graph Attention Networks Implementation

## Introduction

Graph Attention Networks (GATs) introduce an attention-based architecture to compute node features by focusing on different parts of the graph with varying degrees of importance. 

This innovative approach enables the model to learn complex representations of node relationships within the graph, making it particularly useful for tasks like node classification or link prediction in graph-structured data.

## About The Project

The goal of this project is to implement Graph Attention Networks (GATs) using PyTorch, to solve graph-based problems like node classification and link prediction.

By leveraging attention mechanisms, GATs can focus on the most relevant parts of the graph, enhancing the model's ability to learn nuanced representations of node relationships.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

This project requires Python and PyTorch. Ensure you have them installed before proceeding. 

Other necessary libraries include:

- networkx
- plotly

To install PyTorch, follow the instructions on the [official PyTorch website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
2. Install Python packages:
   ```sh
   pip install torch networkx plotly
   ```

## Usage

To run the GAT model for node classification:

1. Ensure you have followed the installation instructions.
2. Navigate to the repository folder and run the Python script:
   ```sh
   python Graph_Attention_Networks_in_PyTorch.py
   ```

The script will train a GAT model on a simple graph, evaluate its performance, and plot the training losses and node representations.
